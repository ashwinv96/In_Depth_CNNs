An in-depth look into convolutional neural networks. Experiments are performed to analyze the effects of: parameter initialization, learning rates, momentum, and batch size on different CNN architectures. The results are compared to a control which is a fully connected feedforward neural network. In addition, techniques to improve generalization are explored. These include ensemble learning and dropout layers.
